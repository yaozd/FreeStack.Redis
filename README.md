## Fork of the ServiceStack C#/.NET Client for Redis

This is a fork of the official C# ServiceStack client for Redis. This fork removes

* the limitation of 6000 commands per hour to the Redis Client
* the limitation of 20 different types in Redis Client Typed APIs 

both imposed to the free version of the official library.
